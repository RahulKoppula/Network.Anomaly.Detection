# Network.Anomaly.Detection
A complete machine learning Intrusion Detection System (IDS) project using Snowflake and Python.
This project demonstrates end-to-end workflow: network traffic data ingestion and preprocessing in Snowflake, feature engineering and storage, scalable data extraction for ML in Python (scikit-learn/Colab), model training and evaluation (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting), and storage of prediction and metric results for further analysis.

    - Cloud Data Engineering: Table creation, preprocessing, and feature engineering with Snowflake SQL
    - Machine Learning: Training and comparison of multiple models for network anomaly detection
    - Data Flow: Bi-directional movement of processed data and results between Snowflake and Python
    - Reproducible Workflow: All SQL code, Python/Colab notebook, and instructions included
